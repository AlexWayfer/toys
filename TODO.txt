# TODO items

This is a dumping ground of possible ideas and future directions for Toys.

## Immediate tasks

* Have .create methods on classes with terrible constructors

## Investigations/wishlist

* Flags can supply the default for when an optional value is omitted (currently nil is passed to the acceptor, which matches OptionParser behavior).
* toys system new: Create toys files and gems
* toys system lint: Check toys file structure and practices
* Range acceptors. May be difficult unless we can limit the types.
* Line length limit for Terminal
* Something to generate output formats
* Namespace clearing/locking
* Integrate with the "less" tool in exec.
* Figure out how/whether to support customizing middleware in toys files
* Additional ways to find terminal size
* Convenience methods for creating pipes/splits/joins in exec

## Other ideas we probably won't do

* toys system clean: Clean old installations of toys. Probably not a good idea because other versions may be in bundles.
