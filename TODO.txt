# TODO items

## Immediate tasks

* Figure out a way for exec to redirect to/from files. Maybe use StringIO instead of String.
* Support directing Exec streams to /dev/null

## Important tasks

* Improve test coverage
* Write user's guide

## Investigations/wishlist

* Named templates the same way as we have named helpers
* Consider a way to exec_tool that uses fork
* Range acceptors. May be difficult unless we can limit the types.
* Line length limit for Terminal
* Required flags and flag groups. Three types: at_most_one, exactly_one, at_least_one
* Something to generate output formats
* System paths tool
* Namespace clearing/locking
* Helpers for various gems like pastel and tty-*
