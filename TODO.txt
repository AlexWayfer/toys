# TODO items

This is a dumping ground of ideas and future directions for Toys.

## Immediate tasks

* .data directory in loader
* .lib directory in loader

## Investigations/wishlist

* toys system lint: Check toys file structure and practices
* toys system clean: Clean old installations of toys
* Range acceptors. May be difficult unless we can limit the types.
* Line length limit for Terminal
* Required flags and flag groups. Three types: at_most_one, exactly_one, at_least_one
* Something to generate output formats
* Namespace clearing/locking
* Integrate with the "less" tool in exec.
* Figure out how/whether to support customizing middleware in toys files
* Additional ways to find terminal size
