# Toys-Core User Guide

Toys-Core is the command line tool framework underlying Toys. It can be used
to create command line binaries by writing *Toys files*, similarly to how
scripts are written for Toys.

This user's guide covers everything you need to know to build your own command
line binaries in Ruby using the Toys-Core framework.

This guide assumes you are already familiar with Toys itself, including how to
define tools by writing Toys files, parsing arguments and flags, and how tools
are executed. For background, please see the
[Toys User's Guide](https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/toys/file/docs/guide.md).
