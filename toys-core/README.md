# Toys

Toys is a command line binary that lets you build your own personal suite of
command line tools using a Ruby DSL. Toys handles argument parsing, error
reporting, logging, help text, and many other details for you. Toys is designed
for software developers, IT specialists, and other power users who want to
write and organize scripts to automate their workflows.

Toys-Core is the command line tool framework underlying Toys. It can be used
to create command line binaries using the internal Toys APIs.

To get started using toys-core for your own command line binary, see the
{file:docs/getting-started.md Getting Started Guide}.
