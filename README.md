# Toys

[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dazuma/toys.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/dazuma/toys/)

Toys is a configurable command line tool. Write commands in config files using
a simple DSL, and Toys will provide the command line binary and take care of
all the details such as argument parsing, online help, and error reporting.

Toys is designed for software developers, IT professionals, and other power
users who want to write and organize scripts to automate their workflows. It
can also be used as a Rake replacement, providing a more natural command line
interface for your project's build tasks.

This repository includes the source for the **toys** gem, which provides the
Toys binary itself, and the **toys-core** gem, which provides the underlying
command line framework.
