# TODO items

## Immediate tasks

* Helper for line_output (maybe in the highline module). Maybe expand it to include write(), implement line length limits, etc.
* Context keys: use strings/symbols only for options, everything else is some other class.

## Important tasks

* Improve test coverage
* Write user's guide

## Investigations/wishlist

* Investigate range acceptors
* Investigate required flags and flag groups. Three types: at_most_one, exactly_one, at_least_one
* Investigate something to generate output formats
* Investigate system paths tool
* Investigate group clearing/locking
