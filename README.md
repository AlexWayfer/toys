# Toys

[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dazuma/toys.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/dazuma/toys/)

Toys is a configurable command line tool. Write commands using a simple DSL,
and Toys will take care of all the command line details such as argument
parsing, online help, and error reporting. Commands can be global or scoped to
particular directories. Toys is designed for software developers, IT
specialists, and other power users who want to write and organize scripts to
automate their workflows. It can also be used as a Rake replacement, providing
a more natural command line interface for your project's build tasks.

This repository includes the source for the **toys** gem, which provides the
Toys binary itself, and the **toys-core** gem, which provides the underlying
command line framework.
