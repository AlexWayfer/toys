# Toys

Toys is a configurable command line tool. Write commands in config files using
a simple DSL, and Toys will provide the command line binary and take care of
all the details such as argument parsing, online help, and error reporting.

Toys-Core is the command line tool framework underlying Toys. It can be used
to create your own command line binaries using the internal Toys APIs.

To get started with toys-core, see the
[Getting Started Guide](https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/toys-core/file/docs/getting-started.md)
