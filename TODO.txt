# TODO items

This is a dumping ground of ideas and future directions for Toys.

## Immediate tasks

* Help text should sort flags
* Should "global" toys paths (e.g. /etc) not bubble up to parent directories?

## Investigations/wishlist

* toys system new: Create toys files and gems
* toys system lint: Check toys file structure and practices
* toys system clean: Clean old installations of toys
* Range acceptors. May be difficult unless we can limit the types.
* Line length limit for Terminal
* Something to generate output formats
* Namespace clearing/locking
* Integrate with the "less" tool in exec.
* Figure out how/whether to support customizing middleware in toys files
* Additional ways to find terminal size
